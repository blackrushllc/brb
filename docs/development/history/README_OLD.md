# Basil 🌿

🌱 A modern BASIC‑flavored language focused on web/back‑end with the 
ability to compile to bytecode or binaries, across all platforms, and includes lots of library modules
such as Zip, Base64, JSON, SQL, MIDI, AI, and more.

🌱 Basil is the first high level interpreted and compiled language designed with AI in mind, from code generation, module building, and even adding features or fixing bugs in itself!

🌱 Basil programs can be compiled
to native binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Basil can also run as a CGI script templating engine
using \<?basil .. ?> tags like Php.  

🌱 Basil is easier to use, and much faster than Python or Php.

🌱 Basil includes lots of sample programs including a complete Website Framework and MIDI DAW application.

🌱 Basil puts the power of AI in the hands of the student, hobbyist, and professional programmer.

🌱 Basil includes the ability to have your favorite AI train itself on how to make Basil Library mods and write Basil code.

🌱 Basil is inspired by Bob Zale's PowerBASIC and the warmth and simplicity of BASIC, 
but reimagined for today's developer needs with modern features, a robust standard library, 
and seamless interoperability with C and WebAssembly (WASI).

🌱 Basil is written in Rust for safety and performance, and aims to provide a delightful developer experience.

🌱 Basil is open source under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license.

🌱 Basil is a project by Blackrush LLC (https://blackrush.us).

🌱 Basil is pronounced like "basil" the herb, and is a pun volcano.

### Quick Try:

🌿 Running a basil program without rebuilding the VM:
```terminal
target/release/basilc run examples/hello.basil
# or
target/debug/basilc run examples/hello.basil
```


Building and deploying Basil to run CGI scripts on Linux:

```
cargo build --release -p basilc
install -m 0755 target/release/basilc /usr/lib/cgi-bin/basil.cgi
```

🌿 Running a basil program with a bunch of libraries

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features "obj-curl obj-zip obj-base64" -- run examples/zip_demo.basil
```

🌿 Running a basil program with a full build (all libraries)

```terminal
cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-all -- run examples/objects.basil
```

Terminal control (obj-term):

- Enable the terminal feature and run examples:
  cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-term -- run examples/term/01_colors_and_cls.basil

- New commands when enabled:
  CLS, CLEAR, HOME, LOCATE(x%, y%), COLOR(fg, bg), COLOR_RESET, ATTR(bold%, underline%, reverse%), ATTR_RESET,
  CURSOR_SAVE, CURSOR_RESTORE, TERM_COLS%(), TERM_ROWS%(), CURSOR_HIDE, CURSOR_SHOW, TERM_ERR$()

Color values for COLOR can be 0..15 or names (case-insensitive):
  0=Black, 1=Red, 2=Green, 3=Yellow, 4=Blue, 5=Magenta, 6=Cyan, 7=White, 8=Grey,
  9=BrightRed, 10=BrightGreen, 11=BrightYellow, 12=BrightBlue, 13=BrightMagenta, 14=BrightCyan, 15=BrightWhite
  Names: "black","red","green","yellow","blue","magenta","cyan","white","grey",
         "brightred","brightgreen","brightyellow","brightblue","brightmagenta","brightcyan","brightwhite"

Examples are in examples/term/.

See the examples folder for lots of cool example Basil scripts. These were mostly produced to test each feature as it was added and then rest everything else so we know we didn't break anything

### Known limitations

- Interactive console input (INPUT\$, INPUTC\$, INKEY\$, INKEY%): On Windows, these functions require a real
  console/TTY. When running basilc via an IDE’s Run/Debug console (e.g., RustRover Run menu), the IDE’s pseudo-terminal
  may not support raw-mode keyboard polling and can cause hangs or repeated key echo. Run interactive examples from a
  regular terminal (PowerShell, cmd.exe ("DOS" lol), Putty, terminal window, etc) for correct behavior. Non-interactive
  scripts and normal terminal usage are unaffected.
- If you must run from an IDE, configure the run target to use an external console or disable input features in your
  script.
- alternatively there is a "test" option to run non-interactively, mock input, and output comments
- There is no maximum number of lines of code in a script.
- There is no maximum number of variables, functions, objects, or arrays.
- There are no limits to the size of strings variables, arrays, or objects.
- ^ in theory

# TODO next

🌿 Add packages like ~~Zip~~, ~~Base64~~, ~~JSON~~, XML, HTTP, ~~SQLite~~, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, LDAP, SMTP, IMAP, FTP, SFTP, SSH, TLS/SSL, WebSockets, JWT, OAuth2, AWS SDK, Azure SDK, GCP SDK


# 🌱 WHAT'S NEW 🌱

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _COMPILER_ !!!

* Adds a new compiler that compiles Basil code to Rust code, which is then compiled to a native binary (Windows EXE, Linux ELF, MacOS Mach-O, etc)
* See compiler folder for a bunch of docs (documentation is ongoing)
* See c.bat for a Windoes batch file to compile a BASIC file from the examples folder, run it if the build succeeds, or output a report to paste into AI to fix whatever the issue is
* ^ example: ./c.bat bigtest - Compiles examples/bigtest.basil to bigtest.exe or generates output for you to give AI to fix
* You can now run programs with the Basil Byte-code interpreter or compile them to stand-alone native binaries


### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _AI support_ !!!

* AI support added
* See examples/ai for several examples
* See ai/AI.md and other AI docs in here for more info and guides
* This is different from the "AI ONBOARDING" support which lets you train AI on how to make Basil mods and write Basil code
* This is actual AI stuff you can put in your BASIC programs

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _Midi support_ !!!

* Midi support added
* See examples/midi.basil for an example
* See MIDI.md for more info

### 🌱 Coming soon: A combination of AI and MIDI which is going to be lit

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _CLASSES_ !!!

+ Classes are now supported
+ See examples/classes.basil to see how to instantiate and use classes
+ See examples/my_class.basil to see how to define a class
+ Classes can have public variables and public functions
+ Classes can be instantiated and interacted with from BASIL scripts
+ Classes are defined in separate files, and can be instantiated from BASIL scripts with the DIM statement.
+ Class files are compiled into bytecode and stored in a .basilx file.
+ Class files can be distributed without needing to share the source code.
+ See CLASSES.md and CLASSES_JUNIE.md for more info

Example usage:

````basil
REM Demo: Using CLASS to instantiate and interact with a class instance

DIM user@ AS CLASS("my_class.basil");

REM Access and modify a public variable
PRINTLN "Initial description:", user@.Description$;
LET user@.Description$ = "These are my favorite users.";
PRINTLN "Updated description:", user@.Description$;

REM Call public functions
user@.AddUser("Erik");
user@.AddUser("Junie");
user@.AddUser("ChatGPT");

PRINTLN "User count:", user@.CountMyUsers%();

````

````basil
REM Example Basil Class: my_class.basil
REM Demonstrates public variables and public functions

DIM UserNames$(100);
LET Description$ = "Default description";

FUNC AddUser(name$)
BEGIN
  REM Adds the given name to the first empty slot
  FOR i% = 0 TO 99
    IF UserNames$(i%) == "" THEN
      BEGIN
        LET UserNames$(i%) = name$;
        RETURN
      END
  NEXT
END

FUNC CountMyUsers%()
BEGIN
  REM Returns the number of non-empty user names
  LET count% = 0
  FOR i% = 0 TO 99
    IF UserNames$(i%) != "" THEN
      BEGIN
        LET count% = count% + 1;
      END
  NEXT
  RETURN count%;
END

````

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _"test" mode_ !!!

+ "test" CLI command to run non-interactively, mock input, and output comments

Example usage:

```
 cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-bmx -- test examples/input.basil

```

Output:

```

> cargo run -q -p basilc --features obj-bmx -- test examples/input.basil

COMMENT: Demo of INPUT$ and IF statements.
COMMENT: LET A$ = INPUT$("\nEnter your name:");

Hello, Bob!
Do you want to do something else? (Y/N): YMock input to INPUTC$ given as Y
COMMENT: Block IF:

Winken
BLinken
Nod

COMMENT: Immediate IF:
You said yes
Goodbye!

```

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _Bytecode is compiled and stored in a .basilx file_ !!!
+ Bytecode automatically recompiles whenever the source file is changed
+ Bytecode is stored in a .basilx file
+ Bytecode runs faster than the original source code
+ Bytecode is portable between platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) using the Basil VM
+ You can distribute the .basilx file without needing to share the original source code



### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _CGI scripts run like Php scripts with \<?basil .. ?>_ !!!

```html
#CGI_NO_HEADER
<?basil
  // Manual header mode: send headers explicitly, then a blank line
  PRINT "Status: 200 OK\r\n";
  PRINT "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n\r\n";
?>

    FOR EACH p$ IN REQUEST$()
      PRINT "<li>" + HTML$(p$) + "</li>\n";
    NEXT
  ?>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _Arrays Working_ !!!
+ String, Integer and Float arrays up to 4 dimensions
+ Array function LEN() returns number of elements in array
+ Array command DIM creates/recreates array with specified dimensions

+ Also added INPUT, INKEY%, INKEY\$ functions for keyboard input
+ Syntax error output shows line number

TODO in this vein:
+ Array functions MID, LBOUND, UBOUND, REDIM, REDIM PRESERVE, REDIM SHARED
+ Copy / Slice etc
+ Maybe Array functions SORT, RESIZE, RESHAPE, TRANSPOSE, RANDOMIZE, REVERSE, FOR EACH Loops
+ Maybe Array types Byte(), Word(), Long(), Double()

```

REM Arrays example for BASIL
REM Demonstrates DIM for string ($), integer (%), and float arrays, with up to 2 dimensions

REM --- 1D integer array (0..5 inclusive => length 6) ---
DIM N%(5);
LET N%(0) = 10;
LET N%(5) = 99;
PRINT "N%(0)=", N%(0), ", N%(5)=", N%(5);
PRINT "LEN(N%)=", LEN(N%);

REM --- 1D float array (0..3 inclusive => length 4) ---
DIM X(3);
LET X(0) = 1.5;
LET X(3) = 2.5;
PRINT "X(0)=", X(0), ", X(3)=", X(3);
PRINT "LEN(X)=", LEN(X);

REM --- 2D string array (0..2 by 0..1 => 3 x 2 = 6 elements) ---
DIM S$(2,1);
LET S$(0,0) = "Hello";
LET S$(2,1) = "World";
PRINT "S$(0,0)=", S$(0,0), ", S$(2,1)=", S$(2,1);
PRINT "LEN(S$)=", LEN(S$);

REM Show that re-DIM resets the array
DIM S$(1,0); REM now capacity is 2 x 1 = 2 elements, previous contents cleared
LET S$(1,0) = "Reset";
PRINT "After re-DIM, LEN(S$)=", LEN(S$), "; S$(1,0)=", S$(1,0);


```

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _FOR/NEXT Loops Working_ !!!
+ Also String and Integer variable types (A$, MyNum%)
+ String concatenation with "+" (direct) or ", " (tab)
+ String functions LEN, LEFT\$, RIGHT\$, MID\$, INSTR
+ Example programs added

TODO in this vein:
+ String functions UPPER, LOWER, LTRIM, RTRIM, TRIM
+ String functions ASC, CHR, OCT, HEX
+ Functions VAL, SGN, INT, SQR, RND, RNDM, SIN, COS, TAN, ATN, EXP, LOG, SINH, COSH, TANH, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN, SQRT, RINT, FIX, EXPONENTIAL

### 🌿 STATUS UPDATE _CGI Working_ !!!

+ See bigger example above and in examples/cgi.basil etc
+ Apache config is described further below
+ Runs Along side html and Php files like normal

🌱 Basil executable can tell the difference between running in CLI mode vs web mode, and you can 
write Basil scripts that respond to HTTP requests or run as normal CLI programs.

# 🌱 STATUS UPDATE _It's Working!!_
#### Prototype v0: tokens → Abstract Syntax Tree → bytecode → VM
The core is in place! We can now run simple programs with functions, recursion, locals, conditionals, and arithmetic.

See TODO.md for next steps.

See GOALS.md for the high-level vision.

See VISION.md for more details on language shape, stdlib, web story, tooling, performance, and roadmap.


# 🌱 STATUS UPDATE _It Compiles_ :clown_face:



# 🌱 HERE'S THE LATEST UPDATE :

# Basil (prototype v0)

Let's Grow some Basil! 🌿🌱🌱🌱


 
🍿 Quick Try:

```` 
# Using the "lex" command to see tokens:
cargo run -p basilc -- lex examples/hello.basil

output:
Print   'PRINT' @0..5
String  '"Hello, Basil!"'       @6..21
Semicolon       ';'     @21..22
Eof     ''      @24..24 
````

```` 
# Or the "run" command
cargo run -p basilc -- run examples/hello.basil

output:
"Hello, Basil!"
````


### (or with the basil puns like chop and sprout)

````
# See the tokens
cargo run -p basilc -- chop examples/hello.basil
# Run the file
cargo run -p basilc -- sprout examples/hello.basil
````

# see help

````
cargo run -p basilc -- --help
````

Output:
```
Basil CLI (prototype)

Commands (aliases in parentheses):
  init (seed)        Create a new Basil project
  run  (sprout)      Tokenize & run (v0: tokenize) a .basil file
  build (harvest)    Build project (stub)
  test (cultivate)   Run tests (stub)
  fmt  (prune)       Format sources (stub)
  add  (infuse)      Add dependency (stub)
  clean (compost)    Remove build artifacts (stub)
  dev  (steep)       Start dev mode (stub)
  serve (greenhouse) Serve local HTTP (stub)
  doc  (bouquet)     Generate docs (stub)
  lex  (chop)        Dump tokens from a .basil file (debug)
 
Usage:
  basilc <command> [args]

Examples:
  basilc run examples/hello.basil
  basilc sprout examples/hello.basil
  basilc init myapp
  

```



## 🍿 The Deep Geek Stuff:

We can make serve (greenhouse) spin up a tiny static file server for docs.


### 🐷 What's Done So Far:

+ Fill parser with the Pratt loop from the plan.
+ Implement a basil-bytecode Chunk and the VM dispatch loop.
+ Wire basilc to: lex → parse → compile → run.
+ Add examples: hello.basil, expr.basil, fib.basil.
+ Add CLI commands: run/sprout, lex/chop, help.
+ Most rudimentary BASIC features:
  - `PRINT` statement
  - `LET` for local variable declaration
  - Numeric literals and arithmetic expressions
  - Function declarations with `FUNC`/`RETURN`
  - Function calls with arguments
  - Recursion (e.g., Fibonacci)
  - `IF/THEN[/ELSE]` conditionals
  - Local variables and parameters
  - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - Stack-based bytecode VM with call frames
+ Basic error handling (panics on runtime errors for now).

# 🌱 Basil Prototype v0 — Public Plan & Skeleton

A minimal, public‑ready blueprint for a modern BASIC‑flavored language focused on web/back‑end. This plan targets a tiny, end‑to‑end slice: **source → tokens → Abstract Syntax Tree → bytecode → VM** with room to evolve into C/WASM/JS backends.

---

## 0) High‑level goals

* 🌱 **Developer joy**: BASIC warmth + modern features (expressions, async later, modules).
* 🌱 **Simple core now, room to grow**: start with a stack VM, evolve to register/SSA.
* 🌱 **Interop first**: design a stable C Application Binary Interface (ABI) and WASI component boundary (later phases).
* 🌱 **Linux + Windows, single binary toolchain**.

---

## 1) 🌱 Repository layout (Rust host)

## 2) 🌱 Language subset / Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)

```
program     := { declaration } EOF ;

declaration := "FUNC" ident "(" [parameters] ")" [":" type] block
             | "LET" ident [":" type] "=" expression ";"
             | statement ;

parameters  := ident [":" type] { ", " ident [":" type] } ;

statement   := expr_stmt
             | if_stmt
             | while_stmt
             | return_stmt
             | block ;

block       := "BEGIN" { declaration } "END" ;      // BASIC-y but modernized

expr_stmt   := expression ";" ;
if_stmt     := "IF" expression "THEN" statement [ "ELSE" statement ] ;
while_stmt  := "WHILE" expression "DO" statement ;
return_stmt := "RETURN" [ expression ] ";" ;

expression  := assignment ;
assignment  := IDENT "=" assignment | logic_or ;
logic_or    := logic_and { "OR" logic_and } ;
logic_and   := equality  { "AND" equality } ;
equality    := comparison { ("==" | "!=") comparison } ;
comparison  := term      { ("<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=") term } ;
term        := factor    { ("+" | "-") factor } ;
factor      := unary     { ("*" | "/") unary } ;
unary       := ("NOT" | "-" | "+") unary | call ;
call        := primary { "(" [ arguments ] ")" } ;
primary     := NUMBER | STRING | TRUE | FALSE | NULL | IDENT | "(" expression ")" ;

arguments   := expression { ", " expression } ;

type        := IDENT ; // placeholder for v0, optional annotations only
```

---

## 3) 🌱 Tokens (v0)

```
Enum TokenKind {
  // single char
  LParen, RParen, Comma, Semicolon, 
  Plus, Minus, Star, Slash, 
  Lt, Gt, 
  // one or two char
  Assign, EqEq, BangEq, LtEq, GtEq, 
  // literals/identifiers
  Ident, Number, String, 
  // keywords
  Func, Return, If, Then, Else, While, Do, Begin, End, 
  Let, True, False, Null, And, Or, Not, 
  Eof, 
}
```

* Scanner produces `(kind, lexeme_span, literal?)` with line/column spans.

---

## 4) 🌱 Pratt parser outline (binding powers)

Binding power table (lowest → highest):

```
=          : 10   (right-assoc, handled specially on IDENT)
OR         : 20
AND        : 30
== !=      : 40
< <= > >=  : 50
+ -        : 60
* /        : 70
prefix     : 80   (NOT, unary -, unary +)
call()     : 90   (postfix)
primary    : 100
```

**Core Pratt loop** (pseudo‑Rust):

```rust
fn parse_bp(&mut self, min_bp: u8) -> Expr {
    let mut lhs = self.parse_prefix()?; // nud
    loop {
        let op = self.peek();
        let (lbp, rbp) = infix_binding_power(op)?; // led
        if lbp < min_bp { break; }
        self.bump();
        let rhs = self.parse_bp(rbp)?;
        lhs = Expr::Binary { op, lhs: box lhs, rhs: box rhs };
    }
    Ok(lhs)
}
```

* Assignment is a special case: if `lhs` is an `Expr::Var(name)` and next is `=`, parse RHS with right‑binding power of 9.

---

## 5) 🌱 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) (v0)

```rust
enum Stmt {
  Let { name: IdentId, init: Expr }, 
  Expr(Expr), 
  If { cond: Expr, then_branch: Box<Stmt>, else_branch: Option<Box<Stmt>> }, 
  While { cond: Expr, body: Box<Stmt> }, 
  Return(Option<Expr>), 
  Block(Vec<Stmt>), 
  Func { name: IdentId, params: Vec<IdentId>, body: Vec<Stmt> }, 
}

enum Expr {
  Literal(ValueLit),              // Number(f64), String(InternId), Bool, Null
  Var(IdentId), 
  Assign { name: IdentId, value: Box<Expr> }, 
  Unary { op: TokenKind, rhs: Box<Expr> }, 
  Binary { op: TokenKind, lhs: Box<Expr>, rhs: Box<Expr> }, 
  Call { callee: Box<Expr>, args: Vec<Expr> }, 
}
```

---

## 6) 🌱 Bytecode format v0 (stack‑based)

**Why stack first?**

* Easiest to emit from Abstract Syntax Tree.
* Minimal VM loop; great for bootstrapping.
* We can later add a register/SSA (Static Single Assignment) Intermediate Representation

and keep this as a portable baseline.

**Chunk layout**

```
Chunk {
  code: Vec<u8>,           // bytecodes & operands
  lines: Vec<u32>,         // optional for errors
  consts: Vec<Value>,      // constants pool
}
```

**Instruction encoding**

* 1‑byte opcode + inline operands (u8/u16 as needed, little endian).
* Jumps use u16 offsets (relative forward/back).

**Initial opcodes**

```
// stack effects in comments
CONST_U8   cidx         // push consts[cidx]                 [+1]
POP                      // pop top                           [-1]
DUP                      // duplicate top                     [+1]

LOAD_LOCAL idx           // push locals[idx]                  [+1]
STORE_LOCAL idx          // locals[idx] = pop()               [-1]
LOAD_GLOBAL gidx         // [+1]
STORE_GLOBAL gidx        // [-1]

ADD SUB MUL DIV          // binary numeric ops                [-1]
NEG                      // unary -                           [0]
NOT                      // logical not                       [0]
EQ NE LT LE GT GE        // comparisons → bool                [-1]

JUMP offset              // ip += offset                      [0]
JUMP_IF_FALSE offset     // if !truthy(pop) jump              [-1]

CALL argc                // call value(fn, argc args)         [-argc]
RET                      // return from current frame         [*]
PRINT                    // debug print top (pop)             [-1]
HALT
```

---

## 7) 🌱 Values & stack frames

```rust
enum Value {
  Null, 
  Bool(bool), 
  Num(f64), 
  Str(InternId), 
  Func(FuncObjId), 
  Native(NativeFnId), 
}

struct CallFrame {
  func: FuncObjId, 
  ip: usize,         // instruction pointer into chunk
  base: usize,       // stack base for locals
}

struct VM {
  stack: Vec<Value>, 
  frames: Vec<CallFrame>, 
  globals: Vec<Value>, 
}
```

> GC: v0 uses `Vec` + reference‑counted function objects; later replace with precise GC.

---

## 8) 🌱 Minimal VM loop (Rust)

```rust
fn run(&mut self) -> Result<(), VMError> {
    use Op::*;
    loop {
        let op = self.read_op();
        match op {
            CONST_U8 => {
                let idx = self.read_u8() as usize;
                let v = self.chunk.consts[idx].clone();
                self.stack.push(v);
            }
            POP => { self.stack.pop(); }

            LOAD_LOCAL => {
                let i = self.read_u8() as usize;
                let base = self.cur().base;
                let v = self.stack[base + i].clone();
                self.stack.push(v);
            }
            STORE_LOCAL => {
                let i = self.read_u8() as usize;
                let v = self.pop();
                let base = self.cur().base;
                self.stack[base + i] = v;
            }

            ADD => bin_num(self, |a, b| a+b)?, 
            SUB => bin_num(self, |a, b| a-b)?, 
            MUL => bin_num(self, |a, b| a*b)?, 
            DIV => bin_num(self, |a, b| a/b)?, 
            NEG => { let a = as_num(self.pop())?; self.stack.push(Value::Num(-a)); }

            EQ => bin_cmp(self, |a, b| a==b)?, 
            NE => bin_cmp(self, |a, b| a!=b)?, 
            LT => bin_num_cmp(self, |a, b| a<b)?, 
            LE => bin_num_cmp(self, |a, b| a<=b)?, 
            GT => bin_num_cmp(self, |a, b| a>b)?, 
            GE => bin_num_cmp(self, |a, b| a>=b)?, 

            NOT => { let t = is_truthy(&self.pop()); self.stack.push(Value::Bool(!t)); }

            JUMP => { let off = self.read_u16(); self.ip += off as usize; }
            JUMP_IF_FALSE => {
                let off = self.read_u16();
                let cond = !is_truthy(&self.pop());
                if cond { self.ip += off as usize; }
            }

            CALL => {
                let argc = self.read_u8() as usize;
                self.call(argc)?; // resolves Native or Func, sets new frame
            }
            RET => {
                if !self.ret()? { return Ok(()); } // false -> returned from top
            }
            PRINT => { println!("{:?}", self.pop()); }
            HALT => return Ok(()), 
        }
    }
}
```

Helpers (sketch):

```rust
fn bin_num<F: Fn(f64, f64)->f64>(vm: &mut VM, f: F) -> Result<(), VMError> {
    let b = as_num(vm.pop())?; let a = as_num(vm.pop())?;
    vm.stack.push(Value::Num(f(a, b))); Ok(())
}
fn bin_cmp<F: Fn(&Value, &Value)->bool>(vm: &mut VM, f: F) -> Result<(), VMError> {
    let b = vm.pop(); let a = vm.pop();
    vm.stack.push(Value::Bool(f(&a, &b))); Ok(())
}
```

## 9) 🌱 Compiler (Abstract Syntax Tree → bytecode) — essentials

### 9.1 🌱 Expression emission

```rust
fn emit_expr(&mut self, e: &Expr) {
  match e {
    Expr::Literal(v) => {
      let idx = self.add_const(v.clone().into_value());
      self.emit(Op::CONST_U8);
      self.emit_u8(idx as u8);
    }
    Expr::Var(id) => {
      let slot = self.resolve_local(*id); // or global
      self.emit(Op::LOAD_LOCAL);
      self.emit_u8(slot);
    }
    Expr::Assign { name, value } => {
      let slot = self.resolve_local(*name);
      self.emit_expr(value);
      self.emit(Op::STORE_LOCAL);
      self.emit_u8(slot);
      self.emit(Op::LOAD_LOCAL); // leave value on stack as expression result
      self.emit_u8(slot);
    }
    Expr::Unary { op, rhs } => { self.emit_expr(rhs); match op { TokenKind::Minus => self.emit(Op::NEG), TokenKind::Not => self.emit(Op::NOT), _ => unreachable!() } }
    Expr::Binary { op, lhs, rhs } => {
      self.emit_expr(lhs); self.emit_expr(rhs);
      self.emit(match op { TokenKind::Plus=>Op::ADD, TokenKind::Minus=>Op::SUB, TokenKind::Star=>Op::MUL, TokenKind::Slash=>Op::DIV, 
                           TokenKind::EqEq=>Op::EQ, TokenKind::BangEq=>Op::NE, TokenKind::Lt=>Op::LT, TokenKind::Le=>Op::LE, 
                           TokenKind::Gt=>Op::GT, TokenKind::Ge=>Op::GE, _=>unreachable!() });
    }
    Expr::Call { callee, args } => {
      self.emit_expr(callee);
      for a in args { self.emit_expr(a); }
      self.emit(Op::CALL); self.emit_u8(args.len() as u8);
    }
  }
}
```

### 9.2 🌱 Control flow (patching)

```rust
fn emit_if(&mut self, cond: &Expr, then_s: &Stmt, else_s: Option<&Stmt>) {
  self.emit_expr(cond);
  self.emit(Op::JUMP_IF_FALSE);
  let jf = self.emit_u16_placeholder(); // record position
  self.emit(Op::POP);
  self.emit_stmt(then_s);
  self.emit(Op::JUMP);
  let je = self.emit_u16_placeholder();
  self.patch_u16(jf, self.here_offset_from(jf));
  self.emit(Op::POP);
  if let Some(e) = else_s { self.emit_stmt(e); }
  self.patch_u16(je, self.here_offset_from(je));
}
```

---

## 10) 🌱 CLI behavior (v0)

* `basilc run examples/expr.basil` → lex/parse/compile/execute.
* `basilc repl` → interactive (line → compile → run frame).
* `basilc dump --tokens file` | `--ast` | `--bc` → debugging.

---

## 11) 🌱 Example programs

**examples/hello.basil**

```basil
PRINT "Hello, Basil!";
```

**examples/expr.basil**

```basil
LET a = 2 + 3 * 4;
PRINT a;         // 14
LET b = (2 + 3) * 4;
PRINT b;         // 20
```

**examples/fib.basil**

```basil
FUNC fib(n)
BEGIN
  IF n < 2 THEN RETURN n;
  RETURN fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
END

PRINT fib(10); // 55
```

---

## 12) 🌱 Testing strategy

* Unit tests per crate (lexer, parser, compiler, vm).
* Golden tests: source → bytecode hex dump → compare.
* E2E: run examples and verify stdout.

---

## 13) 🌱 Roadmap from here

1. **Check in skeleton**: crates, opcodes, minimal lexer, numeric literals, string interner.
2. **Implement Pratt parser** and statements `LET/IF/WHILE/RETURN/BLOCK`.
3. **Bytecode compiler** with patching for jumps; functions + call frames.
4. **Builtins**: `PRINT`, `clock()`; error reporting with spans.
5. **Release v0.1** with examples + docs.
6. **Next**: Booleans short‑circuit, arrays/maps, for‑loops, file I/O, import/module system.
7. **Then**: async runtime scaffold; C‑ABI & WASI plugin MVP; Postgres driver.
8. **Finally**: register/Static Single Assignment / Intermediate Representation and C/WASM/JS emitters.

---

## 14) 🌱 Licensing & contribution

* MIT or Apache‑2.0 for maximum adoption.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` with rustfmt + clippy gates; CI on Windows/Linux.

# AOT compiler (bcc)

A new AOT compiler is available as a separate binary: `bcc`.
It transpiles Basil source to a tiny Rust crate and invokes Cargo to build a native executable.

Quickstart:

```
bcc aot examples/hello.basil --emit-project generated/hello
# or build directly (requires Rust toolchain):
bcc aot examples/hello.basil
```

See docs/compiler/AOT_COMPILER.md for full details, CLI flags, feature handling and templates.
